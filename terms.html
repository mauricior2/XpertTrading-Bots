                <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>

                <h5> Trading with futures, options, forex, CFDs, stocks, cryptocurrencies and similar financial instruments is not suitable for many people. 
                    You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you based on your experience, your objectives, your financial situation 
                    and other relevant circumstances. <br><br>

                Our past results and performance do not guarantee future results. By purchasing and using our software, you understand your own financial risks 
                that come with trading, and XpertTrading Bots is not responsible for any losses caused by our software. You are fully responsible for your your 
                own account while running any of our software. We do not offer trading services, account management, trading advice, nor financial advice. 
                We will never ask for your login info or trading account information. You are responsible for maintaining and managing your own trading accounts. 
                You can only purchase our software as an individual and for personal use. <br><br>

                RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC TRADING: Before you begin carrying out transactions with an electronic system, you should carefully review 
                the rules and provisions of the stock exchange offering the system, or of the financial instruments listed that you intend to trade, as well 
                as your broker conditions. Online trading has inherent risks due to system responses/reaction times and access times that may vary due to market 
                conditions, system performance and other factors, and on which you have no influence. You should be aware of these additional risks in electronic 
                trading before you carry out investment transactions.<br><br>

                RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREX TRADING: Trading in foreign exchange (“Forex”) on margins entails high risk and is not suitable for all investors. 
                Past performance is not an indication of future results. In this case, as well, the high degree of leverage can act both against you and for you. 
                Before you decide to invest in foreign exchange, you should carefully assess your investment objectives, experience, financial possibilities and 
                willingness to take risks. There is a possibility that you will lose your initial investment partially or completely. Therefore, you should not invest 
                any funds that you cannot afford to completely lose in a worst-case scenario. You should also be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange 
                trading and contact an independent financial advisor in case of doubt. Leverage enables traders, using a relatively small amount of money, to take a 
                position that is many times the initial investment. This leverage effect can work both in your favour and to your detriment. The Forex market opens 
                up the possibility to utilize this leverage effect to a high degree; at the same time, however, it also opens up the risk of experiencing high losses. 
                Please trade with caution when you use leverage in trading or investing. Your risk is not particularly limited to the initial investment, but can quickly 
                fall into a negative range in the event of strong movements, meaning you may be obligated to pay far more than your initial wager. <br><br>

                The content provided by XpertTrading Bots does not include financial advice, guidance or recommendations to take, or not to take, any trades, 
                investments or decisions in relation to any matter. The content provided is impersonal and not adapted to any specific client, trader, or business.

                not indicative of future results. Any investment is solely at your own risk, you assume full responsibility. <br><br> </h5>

                <h4>In view of the above, there can thus be no guarantee or promise given for the success or profitability of investments made. By purchasing and using
